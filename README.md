# random-guess-multilingual
A very simple guessing game written in Python, supports three languages: Spanish, Portuguese and English

This is a simple game of guessing a number from 1 to 10. It's written in 3 different "human" languages as I wanted to experiment how to write a "multi-lingual" (international) app in Python.
